## Introduction

This is a single-page React app which allows you to search for attractions in Orlando, Florida. It is a showcase for my skills using the React DOM and accessing APIs.

It was built from scratch using create-react-app.

## Installation

If you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed in your machine:

* Click on the <span style="color:green">green "Clone or download" button</span> above to the right, get all files and folders in your drive.
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `yarn start`

If you are interested in programming, feel free to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and use the code! It is distributed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

## Instructions

* The text field is primarily used to filter the current attractions. Just type in it.
* The text field doubles as a Foursquare search for more attractions: type in it and press the button.
* The user can be zoom into the map and move around, in a Google Maps application.
